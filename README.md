# ðŸš€ LaunchHub â€“ Self-Bootstrapping Devstack Engine

LaunchHub is a Python-based CLI engine that generates complete, deployment-ready boilerplate for common project stacks (HTML, Flask, CLI, etc.) with minimal configuration.

Built to eliminate repetitive setup and enforce clean architecture for real-world development.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Supported Stacks (v0.1)

- `html` â†’ Generates static HTML/CSS/JS frontend scaffold  
  Includes:  
  - `index.html` with injected project name  
  - `assets/css/main.css`, `assets/js/main.js`  
  - Auto-generated `.env`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`

---

## âœ… Completed Features (Increment 1)

- `launchhub init html` â†’ Fully working
- Project folder created under `/projects/`
- HTML templates copied from internal `/templates/html/`
- Placeholder `{{project_name}}` dynamically injected
- Base files auto-generated:
  - `.env` â†’ defaults to `ENV=development`
  - `.gitignore` â†’ ignores envs and Python cache
  - `README.md` â†’ pre-filled with project name

---

## ðŸ”œ Next Phase (Increment 2)

> **Custom Placeholder Injection Engine**

- Allow user-defined fields: `{{author}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{license}}`
- Prompt at runtime (e.g., `Enter project author:`)
- Inject into all files that use these tokens
- Template files become dynamic, reusable, and stack-agnostic

---

## ðŸ›  Usage

```bash
python3 launchhub.py init html
````

Then:

```bash
Enter project name: portfolio
```

Project generated at:

```
projects/portfolio/
```

---

## ðŸ§  Why LaunchHub?

* Standardizes your project structure
* Speeds up idea-to-prototype cycle
* Helps you think like a system engineer, not a script writer
* Designed for real-world use and long-term reusability

---

## ðŸ§ª In Development

* Flask and CLI stack support
* Project tracking database
* Git auto-initialization
* Template plugin system
